The poster sessions are essential for showcasing your project outputs to your classmates. There will be two sessions, and you are required to present your poster on one of the days. Attendance at both sessions is mandatory.


### Poster Session Guidelines

- **All sessions are mandatory.** Your attendance will be checked at the beginning (1:00 pm sharp), in the middle, and at the end (2:20 pm sharp) of each session. **Please join the sessions 10 minutes in advance.**

- Your **camera** and **mic** must be turned on **all the time**.

- **Find your poster BEFORE the sessions**, and also check whether your camera and mic work, and you can share your screen.

- Check your presentation date below. You will play a role of a **presenter** in one session and a **questioner** in the other session.

- During the session you present, at least one team member must remain on **standby** in front of your poster for the entire duration to address any questions. Team members may take turns presenting. Please note that the presentation is one of the factors in [project evaluation](../project/#poster-sessions){:target="_blank"}.

- It is recommended to prepare a **1-minute pitch** to start your poster presentation.

- It is NOT allowed to share your screen to show additional results.

- All **questioners** are required to **submit the peer review form by 2:30 PM** on the day of the poster session. Missing the deadline will result in a 20% penalty to your project score, as specified on the [project](../project/#important-what-is-allowed-and-what-is-not-allowed-please-read-carefully){:target="_blank"} page. Please note that you are not required to submit the peer review form if you are presenting on that day.

- All discussions during the poster sessions must be done in **English**.
